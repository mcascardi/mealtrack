<h2>Instructions for use:</h2><p>This is a do-it-yourself website for tracking what you eat, and how much you spend on food.  Click the Login link below to get started</p>

<p> On the left side are meals.  Chose one of the meals from the pulldown and type what you ate in the box.  It will be added to a running list of everything you've eaten, and the latest meals will show at the top.</p>

<p>On the right side is what you've spent on food.  The first box is for the store name, and the second is for how much you spent.  This is not really meant to keep track of how much each individual apple or sandwich cost (though nothing is stopping you from using it that way), but its intended just to give you a general idea of how much the meals you eat are costing you overall.</p>

<p><strong>WARNING!  This site is very much experimental, and could change, go down, and possibly (though hopefully not) erase some or all the data you put in...just giving fair notice.</strong></p>

<h3>Thanks everyone for helping me test this <a href="mailto:mattcascardi@gmail.com">email me or hit me up any other way</a> to give me feedback.  THANKS!</h3>
